<h1>Game created in OpenGL</h1>
<p>It is a project for college. Using the library for c # SharpGL created a simple game 2.5D. The game runs slow, because we were using the old SharpGL. When I used the new SharpGL worked great ... just on my computer (to this day I cry and I do not know why).</p>

I would like to thank:

- Spo≈Çeczna Akademia Nauk
